# Websocket study

This pattern is so common that websockets provides a shortcut for iterating over messages received on the connection until the client disconnects:
```python
async def handler(websocket):
    async for message in websocket:
        print(message)
```


Before you exchange messages with the server, <b>you need to decide their format.</b> There is no universal convention for this.
In javascript:
```javascript
const websocket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8001/");
```
```javascript
const event = {type: "play", column: 3};
```
To send:
```javascript
websocket.send(JSON.stringify(event));
```

In JavaScript, you receive WebSocket messages by listening to message events. Hereâ€™s how to receive a message from the server and deserialize it from JSON:
```javascript
websocket.addEventListener("message", ({ data }) => {
  const event = JSON.parse(data);
  // do something with event
});
```

Sending an event from Python is quite similar to JavaScript:
```python
event = {"type": "play", "player": "red", "column": 3, "row": 0}
await websocket.send(json.dumps(event))
```
